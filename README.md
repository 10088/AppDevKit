It has been using in Yahooâ€™s iOS app productions for 3 years and future outsourcing apps will use AppDevKit as well. The stability and scalability has been verified on these production app. It makes difficult development easer and save 30% development time in real case. It also cover incompatible issues on different iOS platform.

It has 5 major parts that include command, user interfaces, animate, image and list view support libraries. Please leverage AppDevKit in your iOS project or join our development group of AppDevKit. We will maintain this project for you.
